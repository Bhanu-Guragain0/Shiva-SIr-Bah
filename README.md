# Shiva-Sir-Bash

This Bash script demonstrates asymmetric encryption using OpenSSL in a simple step-by-step manner. It generates a public/private key pair, encrypts sensitive data, decrypts it, and displays the decrypted data.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have OpenSSL installed on your system.

sudo apt-get install openssl

## Clone the repository:

Copy code--git clone https://github.com/Bhanu-Guragain0/Shiva-Sir-Bash.git

## Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd Shiva-Sir-Bash

## Make the script executable:


chmod +x script.sh


## Run the script-
./script.sh


# Explanation
The script performs the following steps:

Generate Keys: Creates a public/private key pair using OpenSSL.
Encrypt Data: Encrypts the data file (data.txt) using the public key.
Decrypt Data: Decrypts the encrypted data file (encrypted_data.bin) using the private key.
Display Decrypted Data: Displays the decrypted data.
Files
script.sh: The Bash script containing the encryption and decryption logic.
data.txt: Contains the sensitive data to be encrypted.
private_key.pem: Private key generated by OpenSSL.
public_key.pem: Public key generated by OpenSSL.
encrypted_data.bin: Encrypted data file.
decrypted_data.txt: Decrypted data file.
